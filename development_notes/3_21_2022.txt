Notes for today...

Ive added dlib face detection to the data detection side of things
    This allows for the actual size and shape of face to be considered.
    I might just remove this to the eyes.

    I am ready to  begin training the network, but I have an idea

    - Lets try training it to only detect the horizontal section
    - Then do the same for vertical

    This is the proof of concept for the final horizontal and vertical network.
        If i can get both working, i might just be able to run it through this in post.
